How to use:
To build the original source (with flags which make it pretty fast), 
simply use make (or make ORIGINAL=1)
To build with neon assembly I wrote, use make NEON=1

Unfortunately, it seems I'm not as good as the compiler. Part of it 
seems to be due to some overhead included with the other files being 
linked.
